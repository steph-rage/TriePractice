# Trie Practice

A Python implementation of a trie, without using any built-in Python methods. 

## Running

Run using Python3. The program creates a trie of names, and shows you which names should be in the trie. It then gives you 5 chances to test and see if it is working by entering something that is or is not in the trie.
